# Ariston NET remotethermo integration for Home Assistant
Thin integration is a side project which works only with 1 zone climate configured. It logs in to Ariston website (https://www.ariston-net.remotethermo.com) and fetches/sets data on that site.
You are free to modify and distribute it. It is distributed 'as is' with no liability for possible damage.
Cimate has presets to switch between `off`, `summer` and `winter` in order to be able to control boiler from one entity.

## Donations
If you like this app, please consider donating some sum to your local charity organizations or global organization like Red Cross. I don't mind receiving donations myself (you may conact me for more details if you want to), but please consider charity at first.

## Integration slow nature
Intergation uses api developed by me based on assumptions and test results. It continiously fetches the data from the site with periods determined during tests to have not as many interference with other applications (like Ariston NET application or Google Home application) but be quick enough to get information as soon as possible.
You may read more about API (`ariston.py`) on the website: https://pypi.org/project/aristonremotethermo/.

## Integration was tested on and works with:
  - Ariston Clas Evo
  - Ariston Genus One with Ariston BCH cylinder
  - Ariston Nimbus Flex
  - Ariston Alteas One (note that `internet_weather` is not supported by this model and must not be included in switches or binary sensors)

## Integration was tested and does not work with:
  - Ariston Lydos. use https://github.com/chomupashchuk/ariston-aqua-remotethermo-home-assistant instead.
  - Ariston Velis. use https://github.com/chomupashchuk/ariston-aqua-remotethermo-home-assistant instead.
  - Ariston Lydos Hybrid. use https://github.com/chomupashchuk/ariston-aqua-remotethermo-home-assistant instead.

## How to check if intergation supports your model
You may check possible support of your boiler by logging into https://www.ariston-net.remotethermo.com and if climate and water heater parts (like temperatures) are available on the home page, then intergation should potentially work.

## Integration installation
In `/config` folder create `custom_components` folder and folder `ariston` with its contents in it.
In `configuration.yaml` include:
```
ariston:
  username: !secret ariston_username
  password: !secret ariston_password
```
All optional attributes are described in **Integration attributes**\

### Example of configuration.yaml entry
```
ariston:
  username: !secret ariston_user
  password: !secret ariston_password
  switches:
    - internet_time
    - internet_weather
  sensors:
    - ch_detected_temperature
    - ch_mode
    - ch_comfort_temperature
    - ch_economy_temperature
    - ch_set_temperature
    - dhw_set_temperature
    - errors_count
    - mode
    - outside_temperature
  binary_sensors:
    - changing_data
    - online
  selector:
    - mode
    - ch_mode
```

## Multiple boilers under one account setup
Multiple boilers can exist under one account and by default first gateway is used to connect to appropriate boiler, so in case of multiple boilers each gateway must be specified individually.

### Multiple boilers Gateways collection
Perform actions in the following order:
  - Login to https://www.ariston-net.remotethermo.com/
  - Click on `MANAGE APPLIANCES` or similar (where all appliances are listed)
  - In the list of devices click on each radio button on the left side, and for each selected device note gateway number in the URL. For example the First device in the list is selected, then URL should look something like `https://www.ariston-net.remotethermo.com/PlantManagement/Index/[GAETWAYNUMBER]>`, note `GAETWAYNUMBER`, which corresponds to device selected. Then select the Second device, note URL change and save new `GAETWAYNUMBER`.

### Example with 4 boilers (2 ariston and 2 aquaariston) with minimal configuration
```
ariston:
  - name: boiler_1_name
    gw: "BOILER1GW"                         # See GAETWAYNUMBER fetching
    username: !secret ariston_username
    password: !secret ariston_password
    selector:
      - mode

  - name: boiler_2_name
    gw: "BOILER2GW"                         # See GAETWAYNUMBER fetching
    username: !secret ariston_username
    password: !secret ariston_password
    sensors:
      - mode

aquaariston:
  - name: boiler_3_name
    gw: "BOILER3GW"                         # See GAETWAYNUMBER fetching
    username: !secret ariston_username
    password: !secret ariston_password
    type: "velis"
    switches:
      - power

  - name: boiler_4_name
    gw: "BOILER4GW"                         # See GAETWAYNUMBER fetching
    username: !secret ariston_username
    password: !secret ariston_password
    type: "lydos"
    selector:
      - mode

```
In example there are 4 devices, for which `GAETWAYNUMBER` was fetched manually and is used as value for `gw` parameter. Parameter `name` must be unique (could be based on `Nickname` from Ariston URL or selected randomly). Gateway must be selected according to integration (see details per integration, which boilers it supports). Sensors, switches, binary sensors and selectors can be specified under each boiler individually. Integration attempts to check for supported gateways when one is specified, and logs corresponding events in case gateway is not found in parsed HTML body.


## Services
`ariston.set_data` - Sets the requested data.

### Service attributes:
- `entity_id` - **mandatory** entity of Ariston `climate`.
- for the rest of attributes please see `Developer Tools` tab `Services` within Home Assistant and select `ariston.set_data`. You may also directly read `services.yaml` within the `ariston` folder.

### Service use example
```
service: ariston.set_data
data:
    entity_id: 'climate.ariston'
    ch_comfort_temperature: 20.5
```

## Some known issues and workarounds

### Climate and water_heater entity become unavailable
Since integration interacts with server, which interacts with boiler directly or via gateway, it is possible that some link in the chain is not working. Integration is designed to constantly retry the connection (requests are sent more reearely in case of multiple faults to reduce load on whole chain). Mostly connection recovers in time, but sometimes restart of router or boiler can help (but not always).

### Only part of data becomes unavailable after it was available
Even though many functions are not accessible via integration once boiler configuration (parameter 228 in the menu) changed from 1 (boiler with water heater sensor) to 0 (default configuration without sensor), possibly due to packets corruption on the way or some specific bit sequence. It caused Genus One model not being able to handle DHW. The solution is to enter boiler menu directly and change the value of parameter 228.
Also boiler might require restart (complete loss of power).

### Unexpected status or temperature reported
For example CH temperature set to 0, which is not in supported range. Try to log in into https://www.ariston-net.remotethermo.com and change the value there. If it does not help try disconnecting heater from electricity and connecting again.
